// Features: self-contained parts of the game (quests, appearance, the mech,
// the hab, the pilot boss, the survey) that hook into the World at fixed
// points instead of growing world.js, snapshot.js and save_game.js.
//
// A feature is an object with any of these hooks, all optional:
//
//   init(world)                    world-level state, once the map is loaded
//   initPlayer(world, player)      per-player state, when a player is spawned
//   beforeAction(world, entity, action)  before each player action is applied
//   tick(world)                    once per tick, after tasks (step 4 of runTick)
//   onKill(world, victim, killer)  an entity died (NPC or player), before it's reset
//   onGather(world, entity, node)  a gather attempt succeeded
//   onQuestEvent(world, player, name)  a dialogue choice fired a named event
//   routeAction(world, entity, action) -> true  takes over a player's action
//       before it's applied (a seated mech crew's clicks drive the mech)
//   dropOnDeath(world, player) -> [ItemStack]  more things a dying player drops
//       into their wreck (cosmetics, a pet)
//   wreckTile(tile, world, player) -> tile  where a dying player's wreck goes
//   xpAmount(amount, world, entity, skill) -> amount  XP bonuses (rested, trophies)
//   craftTicks(ticks, world, entity, station, recipe) -> ticks  crafting speed
//   afterCraft(world, entity, station, recipe)  a batch was just made
//   hitDamage(damage, world, attacker, target) -> damage  changes a landing hit
//       (shields, mech-only bosses); return { damage, blocked: true } style via
//       world.emitEvent if it needs to tell anyone
//   save(world) / load(world, data)              world-level state in saves
//   savePlayer(player) / loadPlayer(world, player, data)  per-player state in saves
//   snapshot(world, viewer) / apply(world, data)  world-level state sent to
//       every client in the viewer's snapshot (viewer may be null)
//   publicPlayer(player) / applyPlayer(world, player, data)  per-player state
//       everyone sees, and the client side of it
//   privatePlayer(world, player) / applyMine(world, player, data)  per-player
//       state only that player is sent
//
// Hooks run in registration order. Features register themselves when their
// module is imported (see all_features.js).
